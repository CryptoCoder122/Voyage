Rahul came up with the idea that a body in downward motion can not directly start moving upwards. It will first slow down, then stop then start moving upwards. That is basic physics and common sense. So that’s how it will happen with our habits. 
We should be encouraged even of our efforts only slow down our downwards descent. Soon we will be moving upwards steadily.
